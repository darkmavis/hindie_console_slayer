This utility is designed to work around the Steam version of Houdini Indie's trouble with OneDrive paths.
When Houdini encounters path issues, it will display an error message dialog box that blocks user input.
The trouble is that path errors trigger the dialog a little too often, as in, pretty much all the time.
This utility is designed to detect that dialog and shut it down.
A red status bar message will still be visible within Houdini.
This is a less than optimal approach to dealing with an annoying problem and your mileage may vary.
Please read the source, proceed with caution, use at your own risk, and enjoy your life again.
